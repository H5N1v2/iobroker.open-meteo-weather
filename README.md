**Tests:**  ![Test and Release](https://github.com/H5N1v2/iobroker.open-meteo-weather/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

**The Open-Meteo Weather Service Adapter for ioBroker.**

## First: If you are looking for a widget specifically for this adapter, then create it using [VIS2-widget-script-om-weather](https://github.com/H5N1v2/VIS2-widget-script-om-weather).

This adapter provides precise weather data, forecasts, air quality, and pollen information powered by [Open-Meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/). It is free for non-commercial use (under 10,000 daily API calls) and requires no API key registration, making the setup process extremely simple.

## Features

* **Current Weather Data:** Real-time retrieval of temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind data.
* **Flexible Forecasts:** Configurable number of forecast days and hourly resolution.
* **Air Quality & Pollen:** Optional data for particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) as well as various pollen types (alder, birch, grass, etc.).
* **Automatic Cleanup:** The adapter automatically cleans up the object structure if forecast periods are shortened or changed in the configuration.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Supports 11 languages (including English, German, Polish, Russian, French, Chinese, etc.).
* **Unit System:** Seamless switching between Metric (°C, km/h) and Imperial (°F, mph) systems.
* **Multi Location:** Add multible Locations.

### Air Quality Data
Currently, only **real-time data (Current)** is supported. 

**Why no forecasts?** The Open-Meteo Air Quality API provides forecast data exclusively on an hourly basis. Processing and storing these large datasets (168+ data points per variable) would result in a disproportionately high system and database load. To keep the adapter lightweight and performant, hourly forecasts are currently omitted. 

*Note: As soon as the API provider offers native daily aggregates, this feature will be integrated.*

## Configuration

After installation, configure the following fields in the instance settings:

1.  **Location:** Add your Location or a name you want.
2.  **Coordinates (Latitude & Longitude):** Determine your location (you can find these on openstreetmap.org).
3.  **Update Interval:** Time interval in minutes (Default: 30 min).
4.  **Forecast Days:** Number of days for the daily overview (0–16 days).
5.  **Hourly Forecast:** Toggle and set the number of hours per day (e.g., the next 24 hours).
6.  **Optional Data:** Checkboxes for pollen and air quality data.
7.  **Units:** Choose between Metric and Imperial.

## Icons & Visualization

The adapter provides dynamic icon paths that can be used directly in visualizations such as **vis, iQontrol, or Jarvis**.

* **Weather Icons:** Found under `weather.current.icon_url`. The adapter automatically distinguishes between day and night (e.g., Sun vs. Moon).
* **Wind Direction:** Static paths under `wind_direction_icon` display a compass arrow corresponding to the degree value.
* **Wind Gust Warning:** A warning icon is displayed under `wind_gust_icon` for wind speeds above approx. 39 km/h (Bft 6), featuring levels 0–4.
